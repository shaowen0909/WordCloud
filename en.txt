Since such an operation is likely to be inlined in practice,
it would be slightly more realistic to do the comparison on inlined code.
In particular, the “overflow” return value will typically only be used in a conditional branch,
so reifying it into an actual integer register value (as opposed to a branching flag) is a waste on
many architectures.

Ouch, I forgot the negative numbers in my prvious comment, let me rewrite:

Something like if “sign of a and b is the same but the sign or rp is different,
then overflow. (you could do that with a multiplications if “a * b * (*rp) overflow,
but I believe this is faster (I am going to try it my self and I will add some results).

Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment.
It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust.
Love can vary in intensity and can change over time.
It is associated with a range of positive emotions, including happiness,
excitement, life satisfaction, and euphoria, but it can also result in negative emotions
such as jealousy and stress.1

When it comes to love, some people would say it is one of the most important human emotions.
Yet despite being one of the most studied behaviors,
it is still the least understood. For example,
researchers debate whether love is a biological or cultural phenomenon.2


Love is most likely influenced by both biological drives and cultural influences.
While hormones and biology are important,
the way we express and experience love is also influenced by our
personal conceptions of love.

Based on this view of romantic love,
Rubin developed two questionnaires to
measure these variables, known as Rubin's Scales of Liking and Loving.
While people tend to view people they
like as pleasant, love is marked by being devoted, possessive, and confiding in one another.
